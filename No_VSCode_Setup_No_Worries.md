# Don't Have a VSCode Setup? No Worries!

If you don't have Visual Studio Code (VSCode) set up on your computer to run the YouTube downloader script, you can use **Replit** instead! Replit is an online platform that lets you run code without needing to install anything on your computer.

## How to Use Replit

### Step 1: Go to the Project

Click this link to access the YTVidDownloader project on Replit: [Open YTVidDownloader on Replit](https://replit.com/@Axiata/YTVidDownloader?v=1).

### Step 2: Create Your Own Copy (Fork)

1. Once you're on the Replit page, look for the **"Fork"** button. Itâ€™s usually located at the top right of the page.
2. Click on **"Fork"**. This creates your own copy of the project, so you can change it without affecting the original.

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. After forking, you will see a button that says **"Run"** at the top of the page. Click this button.
2. A new window called the **"Terminal"** or **"Shell"** will open up. This is where you can see messages from the script and interact with it.

### Step 4: Using the Terminal

- The terminal will show you messages about the progress of your download, including how far along it is and when it is complete.
- **Important**: You cannot copy links from the terminal. If you need to enter a link, you must type it out manually.

### Why Use Replit?

Using Replit is a great option if you want to run the script without setting up anything on your own computer. It works well and is easy to use!
